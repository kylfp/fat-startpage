Fat Startpage
</h1>

<p align="center">
Fat Startpage is a side project created out of frustrations with similar "aesthetic" home/start pages. The goal was to create something that could be easly modified to match your desktops color theme from a graphical interface as opposed to messing with CSS every time I changed something up.
