# Fat Startpage
A simplistic/configurable startpage and new tab page. 

Fat Startpage is written completely with vanilla html/css/javascript. You can change the 6 color areas to to your liking using hex color codes, just as you would with css. Weather location is automatically determined or can be manually entered if the user chooses. The default search engine is Brave. In the future there will be more options for this within the settings.
