Fat Startpage
</h1>

<p align="left">
Fat Startpage is a side project created out of frustrations with similar "aesthetic" home/start pages. The goal was to create something that could be easly modified to match your desktops color theme from a graphical interface as opposed to messing with HTML/CSS every time I changed something up.

Version 1 had its fair share of glitches and shortcommings as it was mostly a project for me to learn some basics of web development. Version 2 has plans for a complete overhaul and to draw from other common open source startpage formats. The intent is to let the user switch between the original fat startpage format, the bento format, and a few other homepages at will and have their settings transferred between them.
